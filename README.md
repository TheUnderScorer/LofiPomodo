## Overview:

* Pixel-art like ui.

## Development

In order to develop the app run:

* `npm run install` - Installs dependencies
* `npm run watch:electron` - Watches changes made on electron side
* `npm run start:renderer` - To start the renderer on `http://localhost:3000` (via `create-react-app`)
* `npm run start:electron` - Starts the electron app in development mode.

### Testing

#### Unit

In order to execute unit tests run `npm run test`

#### E2E

In order to execute E2E tests (via spectron) make sure that the renderer is running (`npm run start-renderer`) and then run `npm run test:e2e`

> Hint: You can also run the E2E tests in docker via `npm run test:e2e-docker` 


### Lint

### Packing

To build and pack the app for your platform:

* `npm run rebuild` - Rebuilds native dependencies for your platform
* `npm run build:all` - Builds renderer and main
* `npm run make` - Creates distributable for your platform

### Releases

Releases are handled via `semantic-release` and are triggered automatically via commits on `master` branch. In order to run release manually run `npm run semantic-release`

> Note: Builds for Apple M1 are being done on my Macbook Pro via a custom github runner, so they are available only when I start the release.
